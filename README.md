    My motivation for doing this project was to understand how to logically format a javascript code. It was an extremely challenging process but in that challenging aspect I learned how to put one foot in front of the other and keep pushing forward. But i also gained understanding in the fact that there is no shame in asking for guidance when needed. Many of my classmates and I got together and discussed alot on how to process this assignment without just copying each other and so this project also was a good way to learn the power in teamwork.
